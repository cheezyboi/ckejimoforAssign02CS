# ckejimoforAssign02CS



===Instructions===

(1)Run the redditTester file in order to run the program
(2)In order to visualize the multimaps, add the guava jar file to the build path in eclipse
-->The file(s) is located in the base folder of this directory
(3)Run file in eclipse (you can run it in cmd or terminal though the multimaps won't work)

I tried to comment as much as possible in the code though much of it still may be convoluted as there are a lot of things that
I did that we haven't gone over in class. The commenting sections withing the code could be more uniform and pretty but
this time around I decided to focus on functionality.

Let me know what you think!
